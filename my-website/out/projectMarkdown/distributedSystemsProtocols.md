Implementation of the Chord Protocol-Based Distributed Hash Table for Peer-to-Peer Networks. Implemented a scalable key-value store using the Chord Protocol for decentralized networks. The Chord Protocol simplifies key lookup, node joining, and leaving processes, ensuring consistent behavior. Conducted performance evaluations on fetch times by increasing the key count from 100K to 1.6M on a system with 100 nodes.

Implemented a replicated state machine using Raft, a distributed consensus protocol, to ensure log consistency across replicas in the system. Implemented log replication and leader election to handle node failures and validated it using rigorous testing with simulated node failures.
