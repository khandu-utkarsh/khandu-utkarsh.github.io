I taught myself programming during the summer of 2015, starting with *Let Us C* by Yashavant Kanetkar. I barely scratched the surface—completing just a handful of exercises using the Dev-C++ compiler on my old Sony Vaio laptop.

In undergrad, I did some programming exclusively in MATLAB. I still have that code, and every time I look at it, I cringe. It's painfully unoptimized and poorly written—I sincerely hope none of my project teammates still have a copy.

My serious programming journey began at my first job in 2018, where I dove into C++ development. That’s when I was properly introduced to object-oriented programming (OOP), and it genuinely changed the way I viewed coding. Before that, I assumed programming was just about loops, if-else statements, and some pointer gymnastics.

Later, during my Master's at NYU, I explored a wider range of programming languages. I worked with C++, Python, Go, and Elixir. After graduation, I picked up JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL—depending on how loosely you define a "programming language."

This article is a reflection of that journey. I’ll share what I admire about each language and highlight similarities and equivalents across them. It's part documentation, part comparison, and all passion.
