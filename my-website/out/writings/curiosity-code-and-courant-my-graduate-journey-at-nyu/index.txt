10:T2ff6,I'm writing this two years after completing my Masterâ€™s in Scientific Computing at NYU.  
Iâ€™ve been meaning to document everything I pursued academically at NYU, and also reflect on how I ended up there in the first place.

Before grad school, I was working in Bangalore, India at Altair, where I developed geometry and meshing algorithms for HyperMesh. That was an exciting time. During undergrad, I had used tools like HyperMesh, Ansys Fluent, and CATIA extensively. Suddenly, I was working behind the scenes on one of them. It felt surreal. Over time, though, I realized I wanted to go deeper into the solver side of things and understand the mathematics behind those systems. That curiosity led me to apply to graduate programs focused on Simulation Sciences, Computational Science, Applied Mathematics, and Scientific Computing.

Computer Science wasnâ€™t even on my radar. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d have a shot at top-tier CS programs anyway. I applied to six masterâ€™s programs:  
- Computational Science at Stanford  
- Applied Mathematics at TU Delft  
- Computational Science at Imperial College London  
- Computational Sciences at Georgia Tech  
- Computational Science at UIUC  
- Scientific Computing at NYU  

Of course, I wanted to get into Stanford. I was hopeful because several people from my undergrad had made it there, but they had better GPAs, stronger research experience, and overall more impressive academic profiles. I didnâ€™t. As expected, I didnâ€™t get in.

In the end, I received offers from two excellent programs: one from Imperial College London and one from NYU Courant. The UK was geographically closer to home, so naturally, I chose... the USA. ðŸ˜„  
Jokes aside, after much deliberation, I felt the kind of research culture and academic freedom I was seeking was better aligned with the U.S. system. So, New York it was.

NYU Courant was a solid choice. Known globally for its strength in applied mathematics, especially in numerical computation, it provided the kind of academic environment I had been looking for. I joined the Scientific Computing program with genuine excitement, driven more by curiosity than by career goals. My plan was simple: take the courses that interested me and see where they led.

Initially, I thought I would go deep into mathematics. I was fascinated by the theory behind solvers and numerical algorithms. But pure math is tough. It demands a strong foundation and a level of mental stamina that I realized I still needed to build. In my applied math courses, I started noticing that I was performing better in the computational sections. The computer science parts were relatively straightforward compared to proving theoretical bounds or establishing convergence.

That realization made me appreciate Computer Science more. Since my program required that half of my coursework come from CS, I ended up exploring a wide range of topics: programming language internals, distributed systems, high-performance computing, and more. These subjects were hands-on, intellectually engaging, and easier to apply in real-world scenarios.

One thing that stood out was the student composition. In math courses, there was a diverse mix of backgrounds, but relatively few Indian students. In CS courses, however, more than half the class was often Indian, and most were focused on getting into Big Tech. It made sense. Those jobs pay well and make life easier. There was nothing wrong with that.

But I never thought that way. My goal has always been to explore what Iâ€™m curious about. Iâ€™ve been that kind of learner â€” driven by interest first and everything else later. And yes, that approach has caused its share of trouble.

So, at NYU, I enrolled in the following courses:

## Courses Taken

Most of my course selections were either mandatory (such as Fundamental Algorithms, Numerical Methods I and II, and Programming Languages) or chosen out of personal interest. I spent a good amount of time trying to deeply understand the material, often going beyond what was required. My time was divided between coursework, teaching assistant responsibilities, grading, completing assignments, and cooking for myself.

I worked hard on all the projects. Some were easy and fun, while others pushed me into unfamiliar territory. But overall, working on them turned out to be one of the most fulfilling aspects of the program.

## Closing Thoughts  

In my final semester, I landed a job at SIMULIA in Dassault SystÃ¨mes. It was a tough market when I graduated. Most people I knew were applying to hundreds or even thousands of roles without much success. I got mine after just 32 applications. It felt incredible.

The only catch was that the job was in Boston, and I really didnâ€™t want to leave New York. But the role was similar to what I had done at Altair, and I liked that kind of work. Equipped with more knowledge and experience, I was ready to take on new challenges. And looking backward, I should not have stopped applying. That story, however, belongs in a different post.7:["$","$Lf",null,{"article":{"heading":"Curiosity, Code, and Courant: My Graduate Journey at NYU","date":"$D2025-05-01T04:00:00.000Z","introContent":"My experience through graduate studies at NYU.","keywords":["life experience","grad studies","NYU","USA"],"type":"life experience, opinion","link":"","content":"$10","toBeDisplayed":true}}]
