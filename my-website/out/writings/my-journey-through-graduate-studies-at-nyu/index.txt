10:T1576,I'm writing this two years after completing my Master’s in Scientific Computing at NYU. When I first applied to grad school, I had no intention of studying Computer Science. My interests lay in simulation sciences, and I was drawn to programs that combined mathematical depth with computational modeling. Scientific Computing felt like the perfect fit.

At the time, I applied to programs in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences. I didn’t apply to a single Computer Science program. My top choice was Stanford’s Computational Science program, though I didn’t get in. Still, I was fortunate to receive offers from two outstanding schools: Imperial College London and NYU Courant. The decision might seem difficult, but it wasn't. The UK was closer to home, but the academic environment and research freedom in the U.S. appealed to me more. So I chose New York.

NYU Courant turned out to be a fantastic choice. It is one of the world’s leading institutions for applied mathematics, particularly in numerical computation. I joined with genuine excitement and selected courses based on curiosity and interest, not job-market calculations.

The program was a hybrid, jointly offered by the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. I hadn’t expected the CS classes to be filled with 40 to 50 percent Indian students, many of whom were focused on breaking into Big Tech. Meanwhile, I simply wanted to explore what fascinated me. Initially, that wasn’t Computer Science, but as I studied more, I grew to enjoy it. It seemed simpler than mathematics at first, and there were countless resources available online to learn from. Gradually, I found myself drawn deeper into the world of algorithms, systems, and software.

Here’s a look at the courses I enrolled in during my time at NYU:


## Courses Taken

**Fall 2021**
- Numerical Methods I  
- Fundamental Algorithms  
- Computer Graphics  

**Spring 2022**
- Numerical Methods II  
- Machine Learning  
- High Performance Computing  

**Summer 2022**
- Stochastic Calculus  
- Programming Languages  

**Fall 2022**
- Computer Vision  
- Monte Carlo Sampling Methods  
- Distributed Systems  

**Spring 2023**
- Algorithmic Trading and Quantitative Strategies  

Most of my course selections were either mandatory (such as Fundamental Algorithms, Numerical Methods I and II, and Programming Languages) or driven by personal curiosity. I dedicated a lot of time to hands-on projects, which turned out to be some of the most rewarding parts of the experience.


## Projects and Research Work

- Improved rendering performance with spatial data structures such as bounding volume hierarchies.  
- Built a complete CPU-based rasterization pipeline including shader implementations and transformation logic.  
- Created an interactive desktop application for real-time 2D graphics manipulation.


### Recommendation Systems: A Causal Inference Approach
- Studied and implemented collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques.  
- Introduced probabilistic latent factor models to explore causal relationships between user behavior and recommendations.  
- Integrated causal inference to improve interpretability and performance of recommendation systems.


### Parallelization of Algorithms for Graphs and Linear Algebra
- Designed and implemented parallel graph algorithms on shared-memory architectures using OpenMP.  
- Achieved speedups of 8x for Bellman-Ford, 7x for Connected Components, and 3x for Breadth-First Search on large graphs.  
- Extended optimization algorithms using MPI and CUDA for heterogeneous computing environments.


### Computer Vision: Semantic Segmentation with U-Nets
- Applied semantic segmentation techniques to satellite imagery using different U-Net CNN architectures.  
- Evaluated model performance on the Landcover.ai dataset with a variety of encoder backbones.


### Monte Carlo Sampling Techniques
- Implemented several Monte Carlo methods including importance sampling, ensemble methods, MCMC, and Langevin dynamics.  
- Focused on statistical estimation in high-dimensional parameter spaces using parallel processing in Python.


### Distributed Systems: Raft and Chord Protocols
- Built a distributed key-value store using the Chord protocol for peer-to-peer networks with consistent hashing.  
- Scaled performance from 100,000 to 1.6 million keys across 100 nodes and benchmarked fetch times.  
- Implemented a replicated state machine using the Raft consensus algorithm, including leader election and fault tolerance.


### Quantitative Analysis of Equity Market Data
- Analyzed trades and quotes data for S&P 500 companies from June to September 2007 to study market impact.  
- Built predictive models using statistical hypothesis testing and regression analysis to validate signal quality.


## Closing Thoughts

Looking back, NYU was a transformative chapter in my life. I learned more than I could have imagined, about computing, algorithms, data, and myself. Most importantly, I rediscovered the joy of being curious and following where that curiosity leads.7:["$","$Lf",null,{"article":{"heading":"My Journey Through Graduate Studies at NYU","date":"$D2025-05-01T04:00:00.000Z","introContent":"My experience through gradu studies at NYU.","keywords":["life experience","grad studies","NYU","USA"],"type":"life experience, opnion,","link":"","content":"$10","toBeDisplayed":true}}]
