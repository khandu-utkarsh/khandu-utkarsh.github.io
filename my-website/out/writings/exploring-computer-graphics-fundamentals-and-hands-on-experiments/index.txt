10:T73e,# My Journey Through Graduate Studies at NYU

I'm writing this two years after completing my Master’s in Scientific Computing at NYU. When I first applied to grad school, I had no intention of studying Computer Science. My interests lay in simulation sciences, and I was drawn to programs that combined mathematical depth with computational modeling. Scientific Computing felt like the perfect fit.

At the time, I applied to programs in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences. I didn’t apply to a single Computer Science program. My top choice was Stanford’s Computational Science program, though I didn’t get in. Still, I was fortunate to receive offers from two outstanding schools: Imperial College London and NYU Courant. The decision might seem difficult, but it wasn't. The UK was closer to home, but the academic environment and research freedom in the U.S. appealed to me more. So I chose New York.

NYU Courant turned out to be a fantastic choice. It is one of the world’s leading institutions for applied mathematics, particularly in numerical computation. I joined with genuine excitement and selected courses based on curiosity and interest, not job-market calculations.

The program was a hybrid, jointly offered by the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. I hadn’t expected the CS classes to be filled with 40 to 50 percent Indian students, many of whom were focused on breaking into Big Tech. Meanwhile, I simply wanted to explore what fascinated me. Initially, that wasn’t Computer Science, but as I studied more, I grew to enjoy it. It seemed simpler than mathematics at first, and there were countless resources available online to learn from. Gradually, I found myself drawn deeper into the world of algorithms, systems, and software.

Here’s a look at the courses I enrolled in during my time at NYU:7:["$","$Lf",null,{"article":{"heading":"Exploring Computer Graphics: Fundamentals and Hands-on Experiments","date":"$D2025-05-01T04:00:00.000Z","introContent":"My experience through gradu studies at NYU.","keywords":["life experience","grad studies","NYU","USA"],"type":"life experience, opnion,","link":"","content":"$10","toBeDisplayed":true}}]
