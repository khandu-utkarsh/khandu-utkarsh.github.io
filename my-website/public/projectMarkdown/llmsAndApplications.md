Over the past month, I’ve started to feel confident in my grasp of the full-stack software development process. Naturally, I turned my attention to the latest technological shift that’s capturing everyone’s imagination: large language models (LLMs).  

After months of using tools like Cursor and observing various agentic applications being built, I realized it was time to dive in and catch up by doing what I’ve always done: learning through implementation.

I began exploring agent development using LangChain and LangGraph, and I’ve been genuinely impressed by the potential these frameworks offer. It still amazes me how much a single prompt, when properly structured, can unlock from an LLM.

This article serves as a documentation of that journey. I’m working on building a simple AI agent, and here, I’ll walk through my current understanding, the frameworks I’m using, and the architectural considerations involved.
