# Optimization and Implementation of Parallelized Graph Algorithms for Shared Memory Architectures

**Date:** May 2022

Implemented a framework for parallel graph algorithms on shared memory machines using OpenMP. Optimized the data access pattern, avoiding race conditions, to achieve a speedup of 8x for Bellman-Ford, 7x for Connected Components, and 3x for Breadth-First Search algorithms on a graph with 1 million vertices and 15 million edges.
