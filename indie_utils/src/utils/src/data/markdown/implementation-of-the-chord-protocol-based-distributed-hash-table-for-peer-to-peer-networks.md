# Implementation of the Chord Protocol-Based Distributed Hash Table for Peer-to-Peer Networks

**Date:** Dec 2022

Implemented a scalable key-value store using the Chord Protocol for decentralized networks. The Chord Protocol simplifies key lookup, node joining, and leaving processes, ensuring consistent behavior. Conducted performance evaluations on fetch times by increasing the key count from 100K to 1.6M on a system with 100 nodes.
